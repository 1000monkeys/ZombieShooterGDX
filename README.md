# ZombieShooterGDX

##### A game focused on survival and building/crafting, inspired by boxhead.



### <u>The goal:</u>

How i envision the game is that there are multiple starting maps, and difficulties to select. You can pick a character you like which has impact on some special abilities in the game. Once the game has started i want the player to be able to gather resources before waves of zombies come on a timer. So it always feels like you have things to kill, gather and build. Urgency will be high because of the timer. 



I envision players building fortresses with turrets and other such wacky things build around a Heart(Something important if it dies the game is lost). Zombies will attack your buildings or walk around them if that seems more logical and possible.  Beside the encampment building part of the game the players have spells they can use, Weapons they can use and weapon skills to unlock. For each different character different skills to unlock.



Monsters will drop loot which will help you build the better swords/bombs/arrows.
In the beginning the different stages of the items will be straight forward linear progression, till the last one where there will be multiple different ones each with a specialty for killing certain mobs.
